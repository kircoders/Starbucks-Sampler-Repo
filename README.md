This project would randomize drink selections like toppings, milks, coffee shots, flavor shots, temperature, etc. for someone who wants to try a new drink at their local cafe. (like Starbucks!)

This is important because coffee is a staple for a lot of college students and adults alike and a lot of people do not know how many different combinations there are for good drinks. Also this would be fun for people to use and the coding would be complex to some extent but not impossible to do.

We would use primarily C++, and use specifically the math library to generate certain items randomly.

Our input would be the weather type, such as whether the weather is sunny, rainy, or cloudy. A user could input what the weather is like outside and the randomizer would automatically adjust which features/aspects of the drink would be included, like whether the drink is hot or cold, has ice or not, and has whipped cream or other temperature-dependent factors or not. This way, the user would not have to keep pressing on a button to generate a random drink so many times and would be able to get one faster.

The output would be the selection made for each individual selection made by the randomizer. The user would also receive an output if they were to input yes for any allergies, which should output altered selections to not include those specific combinations.

One feature we would have is the option to select allergies or dietary restrictions, while another would be one that ranks the drink combination on a scale from 1-5 depending on how it tasted with 1 being not the greatest and 5 being the best. Additionally, recipe suggestions based on user preferences and the nutritional information could be one. Another possibility is that a user can create an account and save their history of drinks. 


## Class Diagram
 
![alt text](/images/readme/UML.png)

The User class has two private attributes, name and age, and a constructor to create a new User instance with these values. The Drink class has one private attribute, temperature, and a getName() method that returns the name of the drink. The syrup and flavor classes are decorators for the Drink class, and they inherit from the Drink class. They each have a constructor that takes a Drink instance and a getName() method that returns the name of the decorated drink. The Hot Chocolate, Chai Tea, and Creme Frappuccino and other classes are derived from the Drink class, and they each have a getName() method that returns the name of the drink. The Generator class has three derived classes that generate different lists of drinks. These classes populate a vector in Randomizer class, which returns a randomly generated name of the drink based on the user's age, the current weather, and/or user preference.

Each class in the diagram has only one responsibility following Single Responsibility Principle. In the given program, we can ensure OCP by using decorators for the Syrup and Flavor classes. Instead of modifying the Drink class every time we want to add a new flavor or syrup, we can create new classes that inherit from the Drink class and add the new behavior as a decorator. This will ensure that the Drink class remains closed for modification, but open for extension, securing Open-Closed principle. To preserve the Liskov Substitution principle the derived classes (Hot Chocolate, Chai Tea, Creme Frappuccino and others) behave like their base class (Drink). We can ensure this by making sure that each derived class implements the same interface as the base class and that they behave in a way that is consistent with the base class. 

These changes helped us to write better code because they are breaking up our tasks and allowing us to focus on one importance at a time. With SRP, single responsibilty principle, focusing on one thing at a time makes code easier to break down and understand as well as debug. OCP states just to add and not modify older code to make tracing easier. LSP states any function or method that works with a base type should work with all of its subtypes without causing errors. This principle makes it easier to reason about code since developers can rely on the behavior of the base type and its subtypes without worrying about unexpected behavior. ISP makes code modular, making it more specific, and should not be forced to be depednent on useless imterfaces. Basically making all code useful and important, makes none of it unhelpful. DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions, which reduces coupling and makes code more flexible and easier to test.

## Installation/Usage
 
 This is a simple command line program. 
 1. Download the code to your local machine from the repository.
 2. Open the terminal and use `cd` command to move to the folder containing the program.
 3. Run the following comands in the terminal:
```
cmake .
make
```
```
./bin/starbucks_sampler
```
4. The program should run. You can answer the prompts to get a random drink. 

 ## Testing

We used Googletest to test the functionality of the program. CI is implemented using GitHub Actions and the badge is present at the top of this file. We also ran Valgrind for memory leaks (see the screenshot below).
